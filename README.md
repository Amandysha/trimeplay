trimeplay
=========

Airplay server for Roku.

Very experimental at this stage. 

Things that work:
   * Viewing photos (although they don't appear to look very good. I think there's an off-by-one error in the transfer somewhere)
   * Changing the photo you are looking at
   * Stopping photo viewing
   * Viewing videos from the Video app. Only ones without DRM!
   * Viewing videos from third parties, such as youtube (Again, only without DRM)
   * Pausing and resuming video
   * Stopping videos

What does not:
   * Anything with DRM
      * That includes mirroring, surprisingly!
   * Starting videos in the right place (for reasons that are tremendously stupid)
   * Scrubbing videos
   * Slideshow transitions
   * Music
