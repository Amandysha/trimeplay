   * Why is the colour often stuffed up on the photos?
   * Sometimes the airplay logo disappears. Note that it comes back if I click refresh in Bonjour Browser?
   * screensaver comes on when viewing photos
   * can we listen for connections in the background? Perhaps not...
   * scrubbing, stopping, etc
   * mirroring
   * Cannot start a stream at the correct position. This is a three-fold problem:
      * iOS tells us the proportion through the file to start (eg 47%), and Roku wants the number of seconds (can we use roUrlTransfer to get the first packet and inspect the header for the length?) 
      * Roku cannot/will not tell us the length of the file, and 
      * Even giving roku an integer offset doesn't seem to work :(
